# How to Fix Technical SEO on Your Website

When you think about SEO, keywords and backlinks probably come to mind first. But without a strong technical foundation, your content won’t reach its ranking potential. Technical SEO is all about making sure search engines can crawl, index, and understand your site.

This practical guide explains what technical SEO is, how to find issues, and how to fix them — step by step.

## What is Technical SEO?

Technical SEO covers the backend parts of your site that affect how search engines interact with it. This includes:

- Site speed and performance
- Mobile-friendliness
- Secure connection (HTTPS)
- Crawlability and indexability
- XML sitemaps and robots.txt
- Structured data (Schema markup)
- Duplicate content handling

A healthy technical setup helps search engines rank your content accurately — and gives users a better experience.

## Step 1: Run a Technical SEO Audit

You can’t fix what you can’t see. Use these tools:

- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
- [Screaming Frog SEO Spider](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/)
- [Ahrefs Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/site-audit)
- [SEMrush Site Audit](https://www.semrush.com/siteaudit/)

Look for:
- Broken links (404s)
- Duplicate pages or tags
- Slow-loading pages
- Incorrect canonical tags
- Blocked pages in `robots.txt`
- Missing alt text

## Step 2: Improve Site Speed

Fast sites rank better and keep visitors happy.

**How to speed up your site:**
- Compress and resize images.
- Use next-gen formats (WebP).
- Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Enable browser caching.
- Consider better hosting if needed.

Tools to test: [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/).

## Step 3: Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly

Google uses mobile-first indexing. Your site must work well on phones.

**Tips:**
- Use responsive design.
- Avoid pop-ups that block content.
- Use legible fonts and big enough buttons.
- Test with [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).

## Step 4: Fix Crawlability & Indexing Issues

If Google can’t access or index your pages, they won’t rank.

**How to fix:**
- Check your `robots.txt` — don’t block important pages.
- Submit an XML sitemap to Google Search Console.
- Add canonical tags to handle duplicate URLs.
- Fix broken internal links.
- Improve your internal linking structure.

---

## Step 5: Use HTTPS

Secure sites (HTTPS) are a ranking factor.

**How to secure your site:**
- Get an SSL certificate (many hosts offer free ones).
- Redirect all HTTP pages to HTTPS.
- Update internal links to use HTTPS.
- Fix mixed content warnings.

---

## Step 6: Add Structured Data

Structured data (Schema) can help you get rich results.

**How to do it:**
- Use [Google’s Markup Helper](https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/).
- Add Schema for articles, products, FAQs, etc.
- Test with [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).

---

## Step 7: Resolve Duplicate Content

Duplicate pages split ranking power.

**How to handle it:**
- Use canonical tags to specify the main version.
- Redirect duplicate URLs.
- Avoid thin content.
- For e-commerce, handle product variations smartly.

---

## Step 8: Maintain Technical SEO

This isn’t a one-time job. Keep monitoring.

- Check Google Search Console for new issues.
- Run audits every few months.
- Keep plugins and your CMS updated.
- Fix broken links regularly.
- Re-check site speed when adding new features.

A healthy technical foundation makes all your other SEO efforts more effective. Clean code, fast loading, mobile usability, and secure connections help search engines and visitors trust your site.
